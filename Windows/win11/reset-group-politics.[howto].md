# How do you reset all politics to the default Windows 11 pro settings?

Resetting all policies to default Windows settings on a corporate-managed Windows 11 Pro system involves several steps. Policies can be set via Group Policy, the Windows Registry, or configuration profiles, and resetting them can vary based on how they were applied. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to resetting these policies:

### 1. **Reset Group Policy Settings**

To reset all Group Policy settings to their defaults, follow these steps:

#### Using Command Prompt
1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:
   - Press `Windows + X` and select "Command Prompt (Admin)" or "Windows Terminal (Admin)".

2. **Run the following commands**:
   ```cmd
   RD /S /Q "%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicy"
   RD /S /Q "%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicyUsers"
   gpupdate /force
   ```
   These commands delete the Group Policy settings stored on the local machine and then force an update to refresh the settings.

#### Using PowerShell
1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Press `Windows + X` and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".

2. **Run the following command**:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy, C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicyUsers
   gpupdate /force
   ```

### 2. **Reset Local Security Policies**

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**.
2. **Run the following command**:
   ```cmd
   secedit /configure /cfg %windir%\inf\defltbase.inf /db defltbase.sdb /verbose
   ```

### 3. **Reset Registry Policies**

To reset policies applied via the registry, you can delete specific policy keys. However, be cautious with this approach.

1. **Open Registry Editor**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.

2. **Navigate to and delete the following keys** (if they exist):
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies`
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies`
   - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies`
   - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies`

3. **Restart your computer** to apply the changes.

### 4. **Check for Active Directory or MDM Enrollment**

If your device was managed via Active Directory or an MDM (Mobile Device Management) system, you may need to ensure it is no longer enrolled in those systems.

1. **Open Settings**:
   - Press `Windows + I` to open Settings.
2. **Go to Accounts > Access work or school**.
3. **Ensure your work account is removed**.

### 5. **Reset the PC (Optional)**

If you want to ensure all settings and policies are reverted to their default state, you can perform a reset of your Windows 11 installation. This is a more drastic step and will remove all applications and data.

1. **Open Settings**:
   - Press `Windows + I` to open Settings.
2. **Go to System > Recovery**.
3. **Under Reset this PC, click Get started**.
4. **Choose the appropriate option** (e.g., "Keep my files" or "Remove everything").

### 6. **Additional Considerations**

- **Backup Important Data**: Before making significant changes, ensure you back up any critical data.
- **Reinstall Necessary Software**: After resetting policies or the PC, you may need to reinstall any necessary software and drivers.

By following these steps, you can effectively reset your Windows 11 Pro system's policies to their default settings. If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
